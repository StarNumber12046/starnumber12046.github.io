# A first look to hugo

## What I think about it

Hi everyone, welcome to my blog. Today I want to share with you my experience with HUGO, a static site generator that I use for making my website. If you are looking for a way to create a fast, beautiful and customizable website, you might want to give HUGO a try. Here are some of the reasons why I like it.

## How fast is it?

One of the main advantages of HUGO is that it is very fast. It can generate thousands of pages in seconds, which means you don't have to wait for long to see your changes. It also means that your website will load quickly for your visitors, which is good for user experience and SEO.

## Themes

Another thing that I like about HUGO is that it has a lot of good themes to choose from. You can find themes for different types of websites, such as blogs, portfolios, landing pages, etc. You can also customize the themes to suit your needs and preferences. For example, you can change the colors, fonts, layout, etc.

## Tweaking

One of the coolest things about HUGO is that it allows you to design a cool looking site by extending the theme with your personal tweaks. You can use markdown syntax to write your content, which is easy and intuitive. You can also use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to add more functionality and style to your website. For example, you can add animations, transitions, buttons, forms, etc.

## The setup

Of course, HUGO is not perfect and it has some drawbacks. One of them is that the setup initially can seem messy. You have to install HUGO and Golang on your computer, create a new project folder, download a theme, configure some settings, etc. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, especially if you are not familiar with the command line, go or web development.

However, once you get past the initial setup, HUGO becomes very easy and fun to use. You can edit your content in any text editor or IDE that you like. You can also use tools like Netlify or GitHub Pages to host your website for free and deploy it automatically.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, I think HUGO is a great tool for making websites. It is fast, flexible and powerful. It has a lot of good themes and it allows you to design a cool looking site by extending the theme with your personal tweaks. The setup initially can seem messy, but it is worth it in the end.
